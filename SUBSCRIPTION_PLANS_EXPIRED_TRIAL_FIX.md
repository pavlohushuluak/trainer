# Subscription Plans Display - Expired Trial Fix ✅

## Problem Identified

Users with **expired trials** couldn't see Plan 1 (or any plans) in the `/mein-tiertraining` subscription management section.

**File**: `src/components/subscription/SubscriptionPlans.tsx`

---

## Root Cause

### Before ❌

```typescript
const getPlans = (): PricingPlan[] => {
  const allPlans = isYearly ? getSixMonthPlans(t) : getMonthlyPlans(t);
  
  // If user already has premium subscription, only show larger packages
  if (subscription.subscribed && maxPetsAllowed) {
    return allPlans.filter(plan => {
      const planPets = getPlanMaxPets(plan.id);
      return planPets > maxPetsAllowed;
    });
  }
  
  return allPlans;
};
```

**Problem:**
The condition `subscription.subscribed` was checking if user was ever subscribed, but it didn't differentiate between:
- ✅ **Active subscription** (should show upgrades only)
- ❌ **Expired trial** (should show ALL plans including Plan 1)
- ❌ **Inactive subscription** (should show ALL plans)

**Result:**
- Expired trial users saw NO plans (because no upgrades available from Plan 1)
- OR if logic was slightly different, they couldn't subscribe to Plan 1 again

---

## The Fix

### After ✅

```typescript
const getPlans = (): PricingPlan[] => {
  const allPlans = isYearly ? getSixMonthPlans(t) : getMonthlyPlans(t);
  
  // Check if user has an ACTIVE subscription (not expired trial)
  // For expired trials, show ALL plans including Plan 1
  const hasActiveSubscription = subscription.subscribed && 
    subscription.subscription_status !== 'inactive' &&
    subscription.subscription_status !== 'expired';
  
  // If user has active premium subscription, only show upgrade options
  if (hasActiveSubscription && maxPetsAllowed) {
    console.log('🔍 Filtering plans for active subscriber:', {
      subscribed: subscription.subscribed,
      status: subscription.subscription_status,
      maxPetsAllowed,
      showingUpgradesOnly: true
    });
    
    return allPlans.filter(plan => {
      const planPets = getPlanMaxPets(plan.id);
      return planPets > maxPetsAllowed;
    });
  }
  
  console.log('🔍 Showing all plans:', {
    subscribed: subscription.subscribed,
    status: subscription.subscription_status,
    maxPetsAllowed,
    showingAllPlans: true,
    plansCount: allPlans.length
  });
  
  // Show all plans for free users, expired trials, and inactive subscriptions
  return allPlans;
};
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Better condition** - Checks for ACTIVE subscription, not just subscribed flag
- ✅ **Status validation** - Excludes 'inactive' and 'expired' statuses
- ✅ **Clear logging** - Shows what's being displayed and why
- ✅ **Expired trials** - Now show ALL plans including Plan 1

---

## Logic Flow

### Decision Tree:

```
User State Check:
  ↓
Is subscribed = true?
  ↓
  YES → Check status
    ↓
    Status = 'active' or 'trialing'?
      ↓
      YES → hasActiveSubscription = true
        ↓
        Show UPGRADES only (plans > current)
      
      NO → Status = 'inactive' or 'expired'
        ↓
        hasActiveSubscription = false
        ↓
        Show ALL PLANS (including Plan 1)
  
  NO → subscribed = false
    ↓
    Show ALL PLANS (including Plan 1)
```

---

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Free User (Never Had Trial)
```
subscription.subscribed: false
subscription.subscription_status: 'inactive' or null

Condition: hasActiveSubscription = false
Result: Shows ALL plans (Plan 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Active Trial User (Days 0-6)
```
subscription.subscribed: true (from trial)
subscription.subscription_status: 'trialing'

Condition: hasActiveSubscription = true
Result: Shows upgrade plans (Plan 2, 3, 4, 5) - Can upgrade during trial ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Expired Trial User (Day 7+) ⭐ (FIXED)
```
subscription.subscribed: false (after expire-trials)
subscription.subscription_status: 'inactive' (after expire-trials)

Condition: hasActiveSubscription = false
Result: Shows ALL plans (Plan 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ✅
Can subscribe to Plan 1! ✅
```

### Scenario 4: Active Paid Subscription (Plan 1)
```
subscription.subscribed: true
subscription.subscription_status: 'active'
maxPetsAllowed: 1

Condition: hasActiveSubscription = true
Result: Shows upgrade plans (Plan 2, 3, 4, 5 only) ✅
```

### Scenario 5: Canceled Subscription (Inactive)
```
subscription.subscribed: true (but canceled)
subscription.subscription_status: 'inactive'

Condition: hasActiveSubscription = false (because status is inactive)
Result: Shows ALL plans (Plan 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ✅
Can resubscribe to any plan! ✅
```

---

## Additional Fix - "Max Plan Reached" Message

### Before ❌

```typescript
if (subscription.subscribed && plans.length === 0) {
  return <div>Max plan reached</div>;
}
```

**Problem:**
- Showed "max plan reached" for expired trials with no plans
- Confusing message for inactive users

### After ✅

```typescript
const hasActiveSubscription = subscription.subscribed && 
  subscription.subscription_status !== 'inactive' &&
  subscription.subscription_status !== 'expired';

if (hasActiveSubscription && plans.length === 0) {
  return <div>Max plan reached</div>;
}
```

**Fix:**
- Only shows "max plan reached" for ACTIVE subscriptions
- Expired trials see plans instead of error message
- Clear, appropriate messaging

---

## Logging Output

### Free User:
```javascript
🔍 Showing all plans:
  subscribed: false
  status: 'inactive'
  maxPetsAllowed: 1
  showingAllPlans: true

```javascript
🔍 Filtering plans for active subscriber:
  subscribed: true
  status: 'trialing'
  maxPetsAllowed: 1
  showingUpgradesOnly: true

```

### Expired Trial (FIXED):
```javascript
🔍 Showing all plans:
  subscribed: false
  status: 'inactive'
  maxPetsAllowed: 1 (or null after cleanup)
  showingAllPlans: true
  plansCount: 5
```

### Active Paid Subscription:
```javascript
🔍 Filtering plans for active subscriber:
  subscribed: true
  status: 'active'
  maxPetsAllowed: 2
  showingUpgradesOnly: true
  (Shows Plan 3, 4, 5 - upgrades only)
```
