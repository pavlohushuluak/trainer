# Subscription Management Section - Trial Display Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: In `src/components/training/SubscriptionManagementSection.tsx`, when a user had an active trial, the header badge was incorrectly showing **"Plan 1 - Expired"** instead of properly indicating it was an active trial.

---

## Root Cause

The component was using `isExpired` from `useSubscriptionStatus` hook, which checks `subscription_end` for expiration. However, for trial subscriptions, we need to check `trial_end` instead. This caused active trials to appear as expired.

### Before Fix:
```
Badge: "Plan 1 - Expired"  ‚ùå (Active trial shown as expired)
Description: "Plan 1 - Expired" ‚ùå
```

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Added Trial Status Detection**
```typescript
const subscriptionMode = useSubscriptionStatus().subscriptionMode;
const isTrialActive = subscriptionMode === 'trial';
const isTrialExpired = subscriptionMode === 'trial_expired';

// Only show as expired if it's truly expired (not an active trial)
const showAsExpired = isExpired && !isTrialActive;
```

### 2. **Updated Badge Display**
Now correctly distinguishes between:
- **Active Trial** ‚Üí Blue badge with "Trial" indicator
- **Active Paid** ‚Üí Green badge with "Active" indicator  
- **Expired** ‚Üí Red badge with "Expired" indicator

```typescript
<span className={`... ${
  showAsExpired 
    ? 'bg-red-100 text-red-800'     // Expired
    : isTrialActive
    ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800'   // Active Trial (BLUE)
    : 'bg-green-100 text-green-800' // Active Paid
}`}>
  {subscriptionTierName} {
    showAsExpired 
      ? 'Expired' 
      : isTrialActive 
      ? 'Trial'     // Shows "Trial" for active trials
      : 'Active'
  }
</span>
```

### 3. **Enhanced Description Text**
For trials, now shows end date:
- **Active Trial**: `"Plan 1 - Trial ends 24.10.2025"`
- **Active Paid**: `"Current Plan: Plan 1"`
- **Expired**: `"Plan 1 - Expired"`

## Translations Added

### German (`de.json`)
```json
"trialPlan": "{{plan}} - Testphase endet am {{endDate}}",
"trialWithLimit": "{{plan}} ({{limit}} {{animals}}) - Testphase endet am {{endDate}}"
```

### English (`en.json`)
```json
"trialPlan": "{{plan}} - Trial ends {{endDate}}",

## Technical Details

### Trial Detection Logic
```typescript
// Get subscription mode from hook
const subscriptionMode = useSubscriptionStatus().subscriptionMode;

// Mode can be: 'free', 'trial', 'trial_expired', 'premium', 'loading'
const isTrialActive = subscriptionMode === 'trial';

// Calculate trial end date
const trialEnd = subscription?.trial_end 
  ? new Date(subscription.trial_end) 
  : null;

// Format for display
const trialEndDate = trialEnd 
  ? trialEnd.toLocaleDateString(currentLanguage === 'de' ? 'de-DE' : 'en-US') 
  : '';
```

### Badge Color Scheme
- üî¥ **Red** ‚Üí Expired subscriptions
- üîµ **Blue** ‚Üí Active trials
- üü¢ **Green** ‚Üí Active paid subscriptions
