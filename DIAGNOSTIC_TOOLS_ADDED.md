# Diagnostic Tools Added ✅

## Problem: "It doesn't work correctly!"

Since I don't know what specific issue you're experiencing, I've added **diagnostic tools** to help us both understand what's happening.

---

## ✅ What I Just Added:

### 1. Subscription Debug Panel

**Location**: Appears at the top of `/mein-tiertraining` (only in development mode)

**File**: `src/components/debug/SubscriptionDebugPanel.tsx`

**What it shows:**
- ✅ Subscription Mode (free, trial, trial_expired, premium)
- ✅ Database Values (raw from `subscribers` table)
- ✅ Calculated Values (frontend computed values)
- ✅ Plan Filtering Logic (why you see certain plans)
- ✅ Trial Calculation (trial_start + 7 days breakdown)

**How to use:**
1. Open `/mein-tiertraining` page
2. Look for purple-bordered panel at top
3. Click "Copy" button to copy all debug info
4. Send me the copied JSON

---

## 📊 What to Check:

### If Trial System Issue:

**Open browser console** and look for:

```
🔍 Trial validation check (trial_start + 7 days):
  isTrialActive: true
  daysRemaining: 5
```

**Check Debug Panel:**
- `subscriptionMode` = Should be "trial" during trial
- `subscription_status` = Should be "trialing" during trial
- `isTrialing` = Should be `true` during trial
- `trialEndDate` = Should show trial_start + 7 days

### If Plans Not Showing:

**Open browser console** and look for:

```
🔍 Showing all plans:
  subscribed: false
  status: inactive
  showingAllPlans: true
  plansCount: 5
```

**Check Debug Panel:**
- `hasActiveSubscription` = Should be `false` for free/expired trial users
- If `false` → Should show ALL plans including Plan 1
- If `true` → Shows only upgrade plans (no Plan 1)

### If Device-Locking Issue:

**Status**: Device-locking infrastructure created but **NOT integrated**

- ✅ Created device fingerprinting utilities
- ✅ Created React hook
- ✅ Created Edge Function
- ✅ Created database table
- ❌ **NOT connected to login/signup** (intentional)

**Need integration?** Tell me and I'll add it (with warnings)

## 🔧 How to Diagnose Your Issue:

### Step 1: Run Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open `/mein-tiertraining`

You should see the purple debug panel at the top

### Step 3: Take Screenshots or Copy Data

Click the "Copy" button in the debug panel to copy all info

### Step 4: Tell Me:

1. **What you expected** to happen
2. **What actually happened** instead
3. **Debug panel data** (copy button output)
4. **Any console errors** (F12 → Console tab)
5. **Any browser console logs** starting with 🔍

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes:

### Issue: "Trial users can't see any plans"

**Problem**: `hasActiveSubscription` is `true` for trial users

**Fix**: Add `subscription_status !== 'trialing'` to filtering logic

**Status**: ✅ You already added this in `SubscriptionPlans.tsx` (line 40)

```typescript
const hasActiveSubscription = subscription.subscribed && 
  subscription.subscription_status !== 'inactive' &&
  subscription.subscription_status !== 'expired' &&
  subscription.subscription_status !== 'trialing'; // <-- You added this
```

---

### Issue: "Expired trial users can't see Plan 1"

**Problem**: `hasActiveSubscription` is `true` for expired trial users

**Fix**: Check status is not "inactive" or "expired"

**Status**: ✅ Already fixed in `SubscriptionPlans.tsx`

```typescript
// For expired trials, they should have:
//   subscribed: false
//   subscription_status: 'inactive'
// Therefore hasActiveSubscription = false → Show ALL plans
```

---

### Issue: "Trial being downgraded before 7 days"

**Problem**: Some function updating database too early

**Fix**: All functions now check `trial_start + 7 days`

**Status**: ✅ Fixed in 5 functions:
- ✅ `stripe-webhook/index.ts`
- ✅ `check-subscription-status/index.ts`
- ✅ `cancel-subscription/index.ts`
- ✅ `expire-trials/index.ts`
- ✅ `useSubscriptionStatus.tsx` (removed auto-downgrade)

### Issue: "Device-locking not working"
